# Abortions-in-NYC

On September 1, 2021, women and girls living in the United States entered a battle for the choices of their own body after the recent decision passed by the state of Texas. Under federal law SB 8, Texas mandates a ban on abortions with a duration of six weeks, despite reason of pregnancy being rape or incest. The rule is regulated and observed with private affiliations, as individuals who deem that a organization or people aiding to provide abortions can report to authority and pursue a sue, despite level of familiarity.

Using the abortion csv file that is given, I showcased data analysis and visualizations that help to show key elements that compare and differentiate among abortion clinics and centers for each borough in NYC. Using Python packages such as pandas and matlibplot, I tested my hypothesis that Manhattan will be the borough that has the most insurance and availability in terms of different types of abortions. Also, I believe Brooklyn will harbor  many more fake abortion clinics than other boroughs. This is tested through visualizations that are plotted through Python plotting packages and data cleaning functions that are available.
